The University of Nottingham's Digital Research Service (DRS).

## On GitHub

The DRS presence here on GitHub is primarily for general purpose shared or reusable code, for use within the team or more widely.

Typically actual DRS software projects will have their own organisations, or be in repositories hosted elsewhere, due to the ownership of the research projects with which the softwre is associated.

Some notable projects are linked below:

- [DECSYS](https://github.com/decsys/decsys)
- [BiobankingUK Tissue Directory](https://github.com/biobankinguk/biobankinguk) 
- [CaRROT Mapper](https://github.com/HDRUK/CaRROT-Mapper)
- [Hutch](https://github.com/link-lite/hutch)
